feat(theme): Integrate ThemeCubit into the application

Wraps the root of the application with `BlocProvider` to make the `ThemeCubit` available throughout the widget tree.

The `MaterialApp` now uses `BlocBuilder` to listen to theme state changes and dynamically switch between the defined light and dark themes. A dark theme is generated from the same seed color as the light theme to ensure brand consistency.
