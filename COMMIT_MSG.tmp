feat(theme): Implement ThemeCubit for state management

Adds the core logic for managing theme state using a `ThemeCubit`. This cubit is responsible for toggling the theme, persisting the user's choice to `SharedPreferences`, and loading the theme on app startup.

Includes comprehensive unit tests for the `ThemeCubit` to ensure its reliability, using the built-in mocking support from `shared_preferences`.
